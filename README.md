### Hi there, Shu Ting here! ðŸ‘‹
_(she/her)_ ðŸ’«

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in __Computer Science__ (B.Sc) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), progressing through my career journey as a __software engineer__ and doing the occasional dabble into __design__.

In my free time you can catch me on the badminton or volleyball courts, hiking local mountains, trying to become a polyglot, documenting my adventures through films and organizing __hackathons__ at [nwPlus](https://www.nwplus.io/)!

I'd love to chat with you, find more ways to connect via [my portfolio](https://shuting-hu.github.io/). ðŸ’¬
